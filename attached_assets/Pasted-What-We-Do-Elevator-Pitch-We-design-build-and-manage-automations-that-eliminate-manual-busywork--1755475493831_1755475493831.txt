What We Do (Elevator Pitch)
We design, build, and manage automations that eliminate manual busywork. We connect CRMs, email, docs, finance, and project tools with Zapier/n8n + custom code so teams ship faster and make fewer mistakes.

Who We Serve (ICP)
5–250 employee SMBs (agencies, law firms, clinics, e-comm/wholesale, construction).

Ops-heavy teams drowning in repetitive tasks (intake, onboarding, reporting, billing).

Tools already in place (HubSpot/Salesforce, Google/Microsoft, Slack, QuickBooks/Xero).

Problems We Solve
Lost or slow-responded leads

Manual data entry / double entry

Slow quote-to-cash

Messy onboarding/hand-offs

Support triage & SLA miss

Weekly reporting headaches

Compliance/logging gaps

Tech Stack
Zapier / Make (client-owned workspaces)

n8n (self-hosted / Vercel/Render/AWS) for flexibility & cost control

Custom: Python/JS for webhooks, parsers, API glue

Data stores: Airtable/Sheets/DB as needed; BigQuery for reporting if required

Security & Access (Client-Safe)
Least-privilege OAuth/API keys; client-owned where possible

Secrets in 1Password/Bitwarden (or client vault)

n8n creds encrypted; audit log of changes; credential inventory & rotation policy

NDA + DPA available when touching PII
